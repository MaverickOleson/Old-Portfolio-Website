            <h1>About my personality</h1>
            <div class="mainText">
                <p>Hello there! Came to see what my personality is like, eh? Well, I appreciate that. I'd say my personality is quite peculiar from others, for better and, occasionally, for worse. For starters, I can get very absorbed into practically anything I'm doing, especially projects. I can go long hours just working on one thing, whether it be for myself or external work. However, if the project is more of a creative project, usually something I don't fully have conceptualized ahead of time, I can get stuck on one small detail for minutes... minutes that add up and cost me a lot more time than it would have if I had decided to not focus on that detail. But this can lead to some really fantastic creations, in my opinion. Plus, this habit does not become an issue when I'm given a deadline. I'm often able to assess the amount of time I'm able to work on something well enough to get things done in the amount of time I have. The only trouble I have with this sort of time management comes when my schedule is interrupted by unforseen forces, beyond my control. If you're curious as to why I get so focused on the details of a creative project, it's because I'm naturally not satisfied with giving something with as little effort as possible, if I can help it. When I have the opportunity to create something, I have to, in the least, make it foolproof, and, if it's something I'm very interested in or that is important, I'll usually take steps to go above and beyond what I normally would. To carry on, another aspect of my personality is that I love to be productive. I have to be doing something worthwhile, most of the time, if I'm able to be doing anything of my own, although I occassionally spend downtime. When I do anything productive, though, it's preferable that I get to do something that matters to me, but, when I do get to <!---->work for someone else, it'll become something worth doing that I'll give me best in. A final fact about my personality is that I have a large imagination. I often daydream briefly throughout my day, and I love being creative.</p>

            <h1>About my interests</h1>
            <div class="mainText">
                <p>-I am fascinated by technology.</p>
                <p>-I've gotten a bit obsessed with coding. I've been working on a few coding projects in my spare time, at least a few times a week.</p>
                <p>-I enjoy listening to music, and I try to write music as well.</p>
                <p>-I like art. I used to like drawing a lot. That hobby's since been dwindled less on, as of late. The same applies to 3d modeling. However, I make my Halloween costume (with occassional help from my mother) every year, and I've done clay sculpting as of late.</p>
                <p>-I enjoy storytelling. I don't read as often as I used to or would prefer, but I still like to come up with stories, some of which I write and some of which I just keep in my mind. I also enjoy film. I used to make, and hope to find time to continue making, my own films. They were just little movies that a lot of children from the 21st century have done themselves, but I hope to make more interesting films.</p>
                <p>-I really enjoy problem solving, such as puzzle games, puzzle toys, math, riddles, etc. One of my favorite video games is Portal. I also solved the Rubik's cube in 16 seconds, once, and had an average of about 20-25 second solves at my best time of speed solving. I used to do a lot of math after school, in my spare time, because I always came up with lots of interesting concepts I wanted to run with. Lastly, I spent about a year of obsession over being able to solve and make riddles.</p>
