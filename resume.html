            <h1>Volunteer History:</h1>
            <div class="mainText">
                <p>-For Boy Scouts of America, I conducted an Eagle Project of leveling ground and putting down rock outside of the front wall of an assisted living home. The project consisted of 20+ people. I got the specifications of the project from a manager of the living home. The manager provided the rock. I contacted a state worker for permission to carry out the project (they had control over the ground), collected donated shovels and donated wheelbarrows with my father, got water and donuts with my father for volunteer helpers, and directed 20+ volunteers to level the ground, wheelbarrow rock, and shovel rock evenly in front of the wall. The project's purpose was to help the appearance of the front of the living home. It was a huge success, and I became an Eagle Scout shortly after.</p>
                <p>-Further Scout related community service, such as other peoples' Eagle Projects</p>
                <p>-I have done volunteer work for Feed My Starving Children three times.</p>
                <p>-I did eight hours of work for St. Mary's Food Bank for two days</p>
